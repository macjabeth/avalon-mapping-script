# Avalon Mapping Script

This script allows Mudlet's mapper to do autowalking on Avalon. To get started, clone the repo (or download it as a zip), then install `avalon-mapper.xml` as a module in Mudlet.

The script is open-source and worked on by myself, currently; but I do accept and encourage contributions. If you would like to add something, you can submit a PR. If you have an idea or find a bug, you can [add a ticket](https://github.com/macjabeth/avalon-mapping-script/issues).
